This simply means that we limit the depth of the recursive calls by a fixed number. Likewise, bounded loops are traversed by a fixed number of iterations. In these cases there is a mapping from programs to logical formulas that summarise the input-output relations of the program. The mapping uses the single static assignment (SSA) representation of programs. The main idea is to unfold bounded loops and procedure calls then create a time-stamped version of the program variables, such that repreated assignments to the same program variable is tracked as assignments to different variables. Once the program is in SSA form, we can extract a logical formaula by treating each assignent as an equality.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Index-1","page":"Home","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"}]
